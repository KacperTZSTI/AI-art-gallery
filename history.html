<p>Proffesional AI reaserch began in the 1950's, when in 1956 it was founded as an academic discipline. The first significant AI art system was AARON, created by Harold Cohen in the late 1960's at the University of California at San Diego. It used a basic, rule-based approach to generate images. It created simple, black and white drawings for Cohen to finish. </p>
<P>Years later, in 2014 Generative adversarial networks (GANs) were designed. This system uses a "generator" to create new images and a "discriminator" to decide which created images are considered successful.</P>
<p>In 2015, Google relesed DeepDream. It used a convoluted neural network to find and enhance patterns in images. Many companies took inspiration form DeepDream's success and relesed their own AI's. In 2018 the website Artbreeder launched. It was one of the firs text-to-image models, and inpired the relese of many others. like DALL-E, Stable Diffusion and Craion, which were used to create the images on this website.</p>
